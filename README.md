## Summary
Your node is REKT and you just realized you don't have a static channel backup? Don't panic! This service might be your chance to get those funds back. 

Register your node to either ask your channel partners to close a channel or receive notifications from peers that need your help. All you need to do is to verify you are in control of the node with your signature that is derived from your seed (and passphrase, if you have one). If you lost your seed too, only Harry Potter may help you in this case unfortunately.
